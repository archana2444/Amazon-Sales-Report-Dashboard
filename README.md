# Amazon-Sales-Report-Dashboard
I created an Amazon Sales Report Dashboard using Excel and Power BI to analyze and visualize sales data. The dashboard features interactive charts, graphs, and reports, enabling users to track key metrics like revenue, units sold, and performance trends. It provides a user-friendly interface for gaining actionable insights into sales data.
